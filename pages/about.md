## About the Willett Album
The Willett Family traveled from Bridgewater, Massachusettes to Meridian, Idaho in 1921 to visit their daughter, Hazel. Their six-week journey was unique in that they traveled cross-country by automobile in a time where automobiles were still not completely mainstream. Even more interesting is the fact that Mr. Willett modified the automobile into an "auto bungalow" - complete with fold-out tents and cots for sleeping. While "auto bungalows" were not completely unheard of at the time, we consider this to be one of the country's first recreational vehicles. Please note that the images in the album are not in absolute sequential order. The order of the images in 'browse' mode is the exact order they were in the album.
## The Willett Family
The Willett Family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. C.M. Willet, their son, Fred and friend of the family, Wendell Fisher. They also brought their dog, cat and several chickens. Their daughter, Hazel, was a faculty member at Meridian High School. Other members of the Willett family resided in Coggon, Iowa.
## Origins of the Album
The album was purchased by a couple from an antique store in Massachusettes. It was purchased for a $8.00 and donated to the Meridian Library.
