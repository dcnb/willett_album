## About the Willett Album

The Willett Family traveled from Bridgewater, Massachusettes to Meridian, Idaho in 1921 to visit their daughter, Hazel, who was a teacher at Meridian High School. Their journey was unique in that they traveled cross-country by automobile, in a time where automobiles were still not completely mainstream. Even more interesting is the fact that Mr. Willett modified the automobile into an "auto bungalow" - complete with fold-out tents and cots for sleeping. We consider this one of the country's first recreational vehicles. Enjoy the images!
